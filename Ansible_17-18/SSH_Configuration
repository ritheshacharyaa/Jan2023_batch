# We can use the samekey Generated by AWS  to c0onnect to all the clients, Need to follow some steps

-  Copy the key  to /home/ec2-user/.ssh    (you can keep the owner as ec2-user)
-  chmod 600 key.pem  (To change the permission , since it is ope to all)


# Check if the SSH Agent is Running: First, check if the SSH agent is running by executing the following command:
- eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add the Private Key to the SSH Agent:
- ssh-add /path/to/vinod_2023_june.pem


When you run ssh -i vinod_2023_june.pem ec2-user@172.31.19.110, you are explicitly specifying the identity file (vinod_2023_june.pem) using the -i flag. 
This allows SSH to find and use the correct private key for authentication.
To fix the issue and allow passwordless authentication without explicitly specifying the identity file, you can add the private key (vinod_2023_june.pem) to your SSH agent. 
The SSH agent will then automatically use the private key for authentication without the need to provide the -i flag.
